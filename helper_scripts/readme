There are two scripts that you will use to help you with assignment 3:
1. parseFastq.py
2. getMuations.py


# parseFastq.py
An examplue usage is:
python3 /home/rbif/week5/necessary_scripts/parseFastq.py --fastq /home/rbif/week5/hawkins_pooled_sequences.fastq

I encourage you to play around with the script and make changes to understand what is happening. 
You do not need to modify code in the ParseFastQ class (lines 88-65).
Lines 77 and 80 show how you would the ParseFastq in your own script. 

This script simply parses a fastq file and prints it back out. It adds a string of "*" and "=" to denote the separate between a fastq block. 
This also makes it easy to create variables to manipulate. For example in line 85 you could save it as a variable and perform operations:
sequence = fastq_obj[1]
print(sequence[0:12])

# getMutations.py
An examplue usage is:
python3 /home/rbif/week5/necessary_scripts/getMutations.py

This script performs a pileup over each position along the reference genome and counts up how many nucleotides are present for each position. 
Right now the script is incomplete and only counts the total number of bases. There is a section of code in there that you can write in so you can count up how many of each base there is (ie how many As, Cs, Gs, and Ts are there?).
